== Description ==
Featured Category allows you to display recent posts from the category of your choosing.

It is perfect for display recent news, projects, and other things you may wish to stand out in your blog.

History:

About a month ago I began searching for a plugin I just knew existed.  I needed a plugin that would allow me to select a category, a number of posts, and display a neatly formatted list of the applicable posts from that category.

For the site in question, I needed to list recent posts from a "Projects" category. I imagined that there would be at minimum a plugin for posting news items that I could modify. I settled with using The_Loop. At the time I made a mental note "I need to turn this into a plugin."

Which brings us to Featured Category, my first Wordpress Plugin. (Be gentle!)

I tried to follow the Wordpress API as closely as possible. 

Once you activate the plugin, , simply load it's settings page and choose the category, the title or "heading" and the number of posts you wish to display. 

If the style is not to your liking, simply modify featcat_style.css in the plugin directory. I have included entries for implemented and unimplemented portions to speed things up.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory "featuredcategory" to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Customize settings via settings control panel in wordpress administration pages.
